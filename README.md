# YoutubetoMp3
Download mp3 file of any youtube video


I often need to download videos from Youtube in mp3 format. There are many websites where you can convert Youtube videos to mp3, but I am giving you a simple Python script that does the same job.

I am using youtube_dl. Command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and other video sites. It requires the Python interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not platform-specific. It should work on your Unix box, on Windows, or on macOS.
